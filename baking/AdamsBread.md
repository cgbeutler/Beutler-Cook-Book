Here is my go-to bread and pizza dough recipe

## Ingredients

- one of:
  - 🥣 bread flour `600g`
  - 🥣 all-purpose flour `600g` and vital wheat gluten `20g`
- 🥣 Oil `10g`
- 🥣 sugar `30g`
- 🥣 Salt `16g`
- 🥣 Water `430g`
- one of:
  - 👐 Sourdough starter `50g`
  - 🥣 Instant yeast `7g (1 packet)`
- for more flavor
  - 🥣 ascorbic acid `2g`
  - 🥣 nutritional yeast `4g`
- for soft sandwich style
  - 🔥 large egg for egg wash `1` (or egg replacement.)

## Instructions

### 🥣 Autolyse

If using instant yeast, mix instant yeast (all `7g`) in warm water (all `430g`).

Mix all ingredients (except sourdough starter and egg wash) in a large bowl till clumps of dry are gone.

Let sit for `30 min`. (This autolyse process hydrates the flour.)

### 👐 Kneed

Kneed dough until it gets smooth. If it is splitting/breaking, it may need more water. (should take `10-ish minutes` to kneed smooth and develop gluten chains.)

Set it aside at room temp to rise for `1.5 hours (instant yeast)` or `12 hours (sourdough)`

### 🍞 Forming loaves

Form into 1 giant loaf  or  split into 2 for smaller loaves  or  form a bunch of little buns.

For classic sandwich style, form into rectangle-ish loaves and place in bread pan. (Will double in size during rise and a bit during baking, so it should fill less-than half the pan.)

Try not to kneed much, as you don't want to remove too much air.

Let rise:
  Sourdough - Let rise for `2 hours` then move to fridge to ferment for `8 to 48 hours`.
  Instant yeast - Let rise for `30 min`.

### 🔥 Baking

- if using steam pan:
    
    (You could also just mist the oven with water a bit.)

    Pre-heat Oven to `480°F`.  Leave dry steam pan in while pre-heating.

    Boil water and pour it in steam pan. Let it pre-heat again for `15 more minutes`.

    Score the the loaf (1/2"deep) and bake it untill just starting to brown (about `11 min`)

    Remove steam pan && move bread (GENTLY) onto in-oven rack.
    Continue baking at `375°F` until golden-brown (about `20 to 30 more min`)

    Turn off oven and crack the door and let the bread cool in the oven on its rack for at least `1 hour` to get a nice crispy crust and perfect bottom.

- if using an oven-safe pot in the oven:

    Pre-heat Oven to `480°`

    Score the top of the loaf (1/2"deep) and place it inside the pot with the lid closed or place on a baking steel with the pot over the top. Bake bread till just starting to brown (about `11 min`.)

    Remove the pot and move bread (GENTLY) onto in-oven rack.
    Continue baking at `375°` until golden-brown (about `20 to 30 more min`)

    Turn off oven and crack the door and let the bread cool in the oven on its rack for at least `1 hr` to get a nice crispy crust and perfect bottom.

- For soft crust sandwich-style:

    Preheat oven to `350°F`

    Score the loaf (1/2"deep.)  Brush the loaf with the egg wash if you want.

    Bake `30-35 mins` until golden-brown. (Toothpick test if you want.)

    Let it cool in the pan for `5 min`. Take out and place on rack to cool for another `10-20min` (inside will finish cooking a bit here too.)
