Here is my go-to bread and pizza dough recipe

## Ingredients

- 🥣 Oil `10g`
- 🥣 sugar `30g`
- 🥣 Salt `16g`
- 🥣 Water `430g`
- one of:
  - 🥣 bread flour `600g`
  - 🥣 all-purpose flour `600g` and vital wheat gluten `20g`
- one of:
  - 👐 Sourdough starter `50g`
  - 🥣 Instant yeast `7g (1 packet)`
- for more flavor:
  - 🥣 ascorbic acid `2g`
  - 🥣 nutritional yeast `4g`

- for soft sandwich style:
  - 🔥 large egg for egg wash `1` (or egg replacement.)
- for pizza dough:
  - 🥣 pepper flakes (for flavor) `2g`
  - 🔥 spelt flour (to make it easier to move around)

## Instructions

### 🥣 Autolyse

If using instant yeast, mix instant yeast (all `7g`) in warm water (all `430g`).

Mix all 🥣 ingredients in a large bowl till clumps of dry are gone.

Let sit for `30 min`. (This autolyse process hydrates the flour.)

### 👐 Kneed

If using sourdough, add the sourdough starter (all `50g`). Kneed dough until it gets smooth. If it is splitting/breaking, it may need more water. (should take `10-ish minutes` to kneed smooth and develop gluten chains.)

In oiled bowl set bread aside at room temp to rise for `1.5 hours (instant yeast)` or `12 hours (sourdough)`. (Till it's about doubled in size.)

### 🍞 Forming loaves

Try not to kneed much at this stage, as you don't want to remove too much air.

For pizza dough, you can just cut them in two and second-rise as balls.

For bread, form into 1+ loaves or form a bunch of little buns. Coat with a tiny bit of flour as they near their shape.

For classic sandwich-style, form into rectangle-ish loaves and place in bread pan. (Will double in size during rise and a bit during baking, so it should fill less-than half the pan.)

Let rise:
  Sourdough - Let rise for `2 hours` then move to fridge to ferment for `8 to 48 hours`.
  Instant yeast - Let rise for `30 min`.

### 🔥 Baking

- for pizza:
    
    Spread dough balls into sheets. Use Spelt flour underneath it to make it easier to move.
    
    Bake at `550°F` or as high as your oven goes on a pizza Steal.
    Preheat an extra `15 to 30 min` to make sure oven is super hot.
    
    Just before putting the pizza in the oven turn the oven to Broil!
    
    Cook for `5 to 8 min`

- if using steam pan:
    
    (You could also just mist the oven with water a bit.)

    Pre-heat Oven to `480°F`.  Leave dry steam pan in while pre-heating.

    Boil water and pour it in steam pan. Let it pre-heat again for `15 more minutes`.

    Score the the loaf (1/2"deep) and bake it untill just starting to brown (about `11 min`)

    Remove steam pan && move bread (GENTLY) onto in-oven rack.
    Continue baking at `375°F` until golden-brown (about `20 to 30 more min`)

    Turn off oven and crack the door and let the bread cool in the oven on its rack for at least `1 hour` to get a nice crispy crust and perfect bottom.

- if using an oven-safe pot in the oven:

    Pre-heat Oven to `480°`

    Score the top of the loaf (1/2"deep) and place it inside the pot with the lid closed or place on a baking steel with the pot over the top. Bake bread till just starting to brown (about `11 min`.)

    Remove the pot and move bread (GENTLY) onto in-oven rack.
    Continue baking at `375°` until golden-brown (about `20 to 30 more min`)

    Turn off oven and crack the door and let the bread cool in the oven on its rack for at least `1 hr` to get a nice crispy crust and perfect bottom.

- For soft crust sandwich-style:

    Preheat oven to `350°F`

    Score the loaf (1/2"deep.)  Brush the loaf with the egg wash if you want.

    Bake `30-35 mins` until golden-brown. (Toothpick test if you want.)

    Let it cool in the pan for `5 min`. Take out and place on rack to cool for another `10-20min` (inside will finish cooking a bit here too.)
