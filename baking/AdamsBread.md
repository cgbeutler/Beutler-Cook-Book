Here is my go-to bread and pizza dough recipe

## Ingredients

Bread flour 600g  or  All-purpose flour 600g and Vital wheat gluten 20g

Oil 10g

Sugar 30g

Salt 16g

Water 430g

Sourdough starter 50g  or  Instant yeast 7g (1 packet)

-More flavor-

Ascorbic Acid 2g

Nutritional yeast 4g

-If soft sandwich style-

1 large egg for egg wash  (or replacement.)


## Instructions

### Autolyse

If using instant yeast, mix instant yeast (all 7g) in warm water (all 430g).

Mix all ingredients (except sourdough starter and egg wash) in a large bowl till clumps of dry are gone.

Let sit for 30 min. (This autolyse process hydrates the flour.)

### Kneed

Kneed dough until it gets smooth. If it is splitting/breaking, it may need more water. (should take 10-ish minutes to kneed smooth and develop gluten chains.)

Set it aside at room temp to rise for 1.5 hours (instant yeast)  or  12 hours (sourdough)

### Forming loaves

(rising will take 2h for sourdough and 30 min for instant yeast)

Form into 1 giant loaf  or  split into 2 for smaller loaves  or  form a bunch of little buns.

For classic sandwich style, form into rectangle-ish loaves and place in bread pan. (Will double in size during rise and a bit during baking, so it should fill less-than half the pan.)

Try not to kneed much, as you don't want to remove too much air.

Let rise:
  Sourdough - Let rise for 2 hours then move to fridge to ferment for 8 to 48 hours.
  Instant yeast - Let rise for 30 min

### Baking

- if using steam pan:  (You could also just mist the oven with water a bit.)

    Pre-heat Oven to 480°F  Leave dry steam pan in while pre-heating.

    Boil water and pour it in steam pan. Let it pre-heat again for 15 more minutes.

    Score the the loaf (1/2"deep) and bake it untill just starting to brown (about 11 minutes)

    Remove steam pan && move bread (GENTLY) onto in-oven rack.
    Continue baking at 375°F until golden-brown (about 20 to 30 more minutes)

    Turn off oven and crack the door and let the bread cool in the oven on its rack for at least an hour to get a nice crispy crust and perfect bottom.

- if using an oven-safe pot in the oven:

    Pre-heat Oven to 480°

    Score the top of the loaf (1/2"deep) and place it inside the pot with the lid closed or place on a baking steel with the pot over the top. Bake bread till just starting to brown (about 11 minutes.)

    Remove the pot and move bread (GENTLY) onto in-oven rack.
    Continue baking at 375° until golden-brown (about 20 to 30 more minutes)

    Turn off oven and crack the door and let the bread cool in the oven on its rack for at least an hour to get a nice crispy crust and perfect bottom.

- For soft crust sandwich-style:

    Preheat oven to 350°F

    Score the loaf (1/2"deep.)  Brush the loaf with the egg wash if you want.

    Bake 30-35 mins until golden-brown. (Toothpick test if you want.)

    Let it cool in the pan for 5 min. Take out and place on rack to cool for another 10-20min (inside will finish cooking a bit here too.)
